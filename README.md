## Inspiration and What It Does
For this hackathon we decided people staying on track with exercise routines was a common issue. We know that many people struggle to find the right workout plan and stick to it, as well as do it correctly and we want to change that.

We know that it is important to keep the users engaged and motivated, especially if they don't have the motivation to go to the gym and this is any easy way to to do it the right way from the comfort of your own home. To make it even better all you have to do is make an account. We decided to create a website that would provide a wide variety of exercises and poses, and also help them to track their progress over time. With this idea in mind, We worked tirelessly for the 24 hours of the hackathon.

## How we built it
Our project uses TensorFlow for computer vision and Next.js and React for the front-end. We plan to integrate new technologies as they become available to improve the user experience and make development more efficient.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the issues that we encountered was related to certain calculations that needed to be performed for our project. These calculations were complex and required significant computational resources, which posed a challenge for us. Additionally, we also faced issues with our backend systems, which we struggled to configure to the needs of our project. As a result, this made it difficult to implement certain features or functionality. Furthermore, another challenge that we encountered was related to computer vision, as well as the solver to implement the formula. Additionally, tasks like post detection were a challenge to implement and caused issues, which added to the challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We accomplished the goals we set out to do and it came out better than expected.  We knew it wasn't going to be perfect based of the time constraints and we knew it was going to be a lot and we did great compared to if we played this out differently.

## What we learned
As a team we learned how to act as a team and come up with ideas together. We learned how to manage time to get everything we can out of our time. The newer members of the team got to experience a hackathon, some tech talks, and learn a bit of the code as well as the designing, while the older member got to experience working on a big project in about 24 hours. 

## What's next for MoveMaster
To make the website more interactive, we plan to implement a feature that would allow the users to take live video of themselves doing the exercises and compare it to the correct form for the exercise, this feature would help them to make sure they were doing the exercises correctly and also to avoid injury.
